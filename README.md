# feature-engineering-on-a-traffic-volume-prediction-
## Task 1
1.	Load the dataset into a dataframe that can be used for predicting  traffic_volume a day in advance.
2.	Produce some plots at different time-scales to see if there is periodicity in the traffic volume.
## Task 2
1.	Extract hour, day and month features from the time-stamps. 
2.	Divide the data into train and test sets keeping one third of the data for testing. 
3.	Build two different regression models and test the accuracy. Try Linear Regression and one other regression model from scikit learn.
## Task 3
1.	Given that the linear numeric encoding of the hour, day and month features may miss cyclical signals, investigate and test a cyclical strategy for encoding these features. Does this strategy improve accuracy for the models tested in Task 2?
## Task 4
1.	Identify subsets of the features for this prediction task. These can be the same subset for all models or model-specific subsets.
